**Description:**

This repository includes my capstone projects for Thinkful bootcamp on **Supervised Models** and **Unsupervised Models**.<br><br>



**Data Source:**

I use Russian trolls tweets data-set provided by Dr. Warren and Dr. Linvil from Clemson University, 
available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets. <br><br>


**Objective:**

First, I apply textual analysis on the contents of the tweets. 
Second, I use the features created from my textual analysis to predict the likelihood of retweeting the tweets generated by Russian trolls
by using supervised models.<br>
